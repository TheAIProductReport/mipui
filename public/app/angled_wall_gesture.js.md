### 1. Overview

The `AngledWallGesture` class represents a gesture that allows users to add or remove angled walls within a game or application. It extends the `ShapeGesture` class, inheriting its core functionalities for handling shape gestures.

### 2. Constructor

The `AngledWallGesture` constructor initializes the class with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `layer` |  |  The layer in which the angled wall will be placed.  |
| `kind` |  |  The kind of wall being manipulated (e.g., "smooth").  |
| `variation` |  |  The specific variation of the wall (e.g., "angled").  |

**Note:**  The `AngledWallGesture` constructor initializes a `wallRemovingGesture_` instance of type `WallGesture` which is used to remove walls.

### 3. Methods

#### 3.1 `populateCellMasks_(cell)`

This method populates a `Map` called `cellMasks_` with the masks representing the angled wall based on the `cell`'s role and the current gesture mode. The method recursively calls itself for certain types of cells, ensuring that the mask reflects the presence or absence of walls in neighboring cells.

##### 3.1.1  `isAnySquare_(cells)`

This private method checks if any of the provided `cells` are square walls. It returns `true` if any of the cells are square walls and `false` otherwise.

#### 3.2 `isWall_(cell)`

This method checks if a given `cell` is an angled or square wall.

#### 3.3 `connectIfWallOrWillBecomeWall_(cell, mask)`

This method connects a `cell` to the angled wall if the cell is already a wall or will become a wall due to the gesture. The method populates the cell's mask with the provided `mask` value.

#### 3.4 `populateCellMaskIfWall_()`

This method populates the mask of a neighboring `cell` if it's a wall.

#### 3.5 `isNeighborWall_(cell, dir)`

This method checks if a neighboring cell in a given direction (`dir`) is a wall.

#### 3.6 `populateCellMask_(cell, mask)`

This method populates the mask of a `cell` with the provided `mask` value, taking into account the presence of any neighboring walls.

#### 3.7 `calcFinalContent_(cell, content)`

This method calculates the final content to be applied to a `cell` based on the gesture mode and the existing wall connections.

### 4. Properties

The `AngledWallGesture` class uses the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `wallRemovingGesture_` | `WallGesture` | A `WallGesture` instance used to remove walls. |
| `cellMasks_` | `Map` | A `Map` that stores masks for each cell involved in the gesture. |

**Note:** This documentation omits the `mode_` property as it's inherited from the `ShapeGesture` class.
